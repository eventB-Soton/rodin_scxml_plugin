This is the discussion...
Compare the behaviour of a visually similar statechart (SecBot?) in \iUMLB and \SCXML 
	Based on their \EventB translations
	Using the theorem prover to test whether they are equivalent (they are not)
	Using the model checker to compare traces
	Using LTL to show that certain temporal properties are not achieved by the \iUMLB version.


Early attempts – 
1)	Simple next step – based on negated guards – negation is weakened
2)	Engine – improves the R2C semantics but still suffers from the negated guards problem (refinement of the user model kinda works – simulations at the user level).
\ColinCommented{IF POSSIBLE? use the secbot example to illustrate the problem of guard stengthening on refinement}

The solution:
3)	Transition combinations approach – works because there is always one event to completion. Invariants as well as simulations. 
a.	Explosion – mitigated by mutual exclusions… same trigger – different state-chart regions.

What can we do with it? 
	Why is RTC needed?
	Refinement in RTC
