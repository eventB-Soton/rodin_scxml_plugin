\begin{abstract}

State-chart modelling notations, such as State Chart eXtensible Markup Language (SCXML), with so-called `run to completion' semantics and simulation tools for validation, are popular with engineers for designing machines. However, they do not support refinement and they lack formal verification methods and tools. Properties concerning the synchronisation between different parts of a machine may be difficult to verify for all scenarios.  Event-B, on the other hand, is based on refinement from an initial abstraction and is designed to make formal verification by automatic theorem provers feasible, obviating the need for instantiation and testing. We would like to combine the best of both approaches by incorporating a notion of refinement, similar to that of Event-B, into SCXML and leveraging Event-B's tool support for proof. We describe some the pitfalls in translating 'run to completion' models to Event-B refinements, and suggest a solution and propose extensions to the SCXML syntax to describe refinements. We illustrate the approach using our prototype translation tools and show by example, how a synchronisation property between parallel state-charts can be automatically proven at an incomplete refinement level by translation into Event-B.
