\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\ColinInlineCommented{maybe consider the note below (from our previous plans for a paper)
	
	Note: Things to highlight with the choice of example
	1.	Look at a system that is better model with SCXML run to completion semantics than iUML-B semantics
	2.	Look at how you can check for violations of refinement in a SCXML model construction
	3.	Look at the sort of invariant properties you can verify about a SCXML model
}
This is the conclusion...

\RobCommented{Add some stuff on auto-abstract interpretation. (?)}

While Statecharts interpreted in iUML-B provide a way to incorporate
refinement in an intuitive way, reversing this to {\emph discover}
refinements holds promise.  Checking a particular Statechart model for
heirarchical structures that happen to follow the refinement proof
obligations suggests an automatic way to accomplish abstract
interpretation on an existing model.  Such discovered
abstraction/refinement relationships might improve the scalability of
more complex Statechart models ``for free''.
