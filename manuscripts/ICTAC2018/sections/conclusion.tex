\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\ColinCommented{maybe consider the note below (from our previous plans for a paper)
	
	Note: Things to highlight with the choice of example
	1.	Look at a system that is better model with SCXML run to completion semantics than iUML-B semantics
	2.	Look at how you can check for violations of refinement in a SCXML model construction
	3.	Look at the sort of invariant properties you can verify about a SCXML model
}
This is the conclusion...
