\subsection{SCXML}
\label{sec:scxml}

SCXML is a modelling language based on Harel state-charts with facilities for adding data elements that are manipulated by transition actions and used in conditions for their firing. SCXML follows the usual `run to completion' semantics of such state-chart languages, where trigger events may be needed to enable transitions. Trigger events are queued when they are raised and then one is de-queued and consumed by firing all the transitions that it enables, followed by any (un-triggered) transitions that then become enabled due to the change of state caused by the initial transition firing. This is repeated until no transitions are enabled and then the next trigger is de-queued and consumed. There are two kinds of triggers: internal triggers are raised by transitions and external triggers are raised by the environment (spontaneously as far as our model is concerned). An external trigger may only be consumed when the internal trigger queue has been emptied.
