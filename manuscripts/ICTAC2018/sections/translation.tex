\section{SCXML Translation}
\label{sec:translation}

A tool to automatically translate \SCXML models into \iUMLB has been produced. 
The tool is based on the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and uses a \SCXML metamodel provided by Sirius~\cite{siriuswebsite} which has good support for extensibility. 
The tooling for \iUMLB and \EventB already contains EMF metamodels and provides a generic translator framework which has been specialised for the \SCXML to \iUMLB translation. 

Each \SCXML transition is translated into a corresponding \iUMLB transition. 
Figure~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif} shows the \iUMLB representation, first refinement level design, of the intrusion detection system described in
figure~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}. 
In the translation from \iUMLB to \EventB the `run to completion' semantics is supported by \EventB through the construction of a basis that constitutes an abstract execution model, which all designed systems refine. 
The basis includes \EventB context and machine. 
The context, shown in~\ref{lst:BasisContext}, defines the basis triggers as a partition of internal and external triggers, declared as |SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger| and |SCXML_FutureExternalTrigger| respectively. 
The abstract model of the SecBot extends the basis context and declares a new axiom that defines the partitions of the |SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger| set, which would include the \textbf{spi\_done} trigger and a new partition |SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger0| to enable the introduction of additional internal triggers by subsequent refinements as shown in line~\ref{line:refPartition} of listing~\ref{lst:SecBotCont0}.

	AXIOMS
		partition(SCXML_TRIGGER,
				SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger,SCXML_FutureExternalTrigger) 
	END
\end{lstlisting}

		spi_done	 	//trigger
	AXIOMS
		SCXML_FutureExternalTrigger0=SCXML_FutureExternalTrigger
		partition(SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger,
						SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger0,{spi_done}) |\label{line:refPartition}|
	END
\end{lstlisting}

The basis machine, partially shown in Listing~\ref{lst:BasisMachine}, declares the variables that correspond to the triggers present in the queue at any given time, as well as, the |SCXML_uc| flag, which signals when a run to completion macro-step has been completed and no un-triggered transitions are enabled. 
At the point of initialization, both queues are empty and |SCXML_uc| is set to false. 
The parametric |SCXML_futureExternalTrigger| event updates the external trigger queue with any newly raised trigger. 
To raise an external trigger, each external trigger in the model must extend this event. 
% If more than one external trigger have to be raised at the same time.  
The |SCXML_futureInternalTransitionSet| basis event must be refined by any event in the model conditioned on an internal trigger. 
The guards of this event check for the completion of the previous macro-step. 
A similar behavior is followed by |SCXML_futureExternalTransitionSet| event, if internal triggers are in the queue.

To completely control the execution flow of the model, all un-triggered transitions must refine the |SCXML_futureUntriggeredTransitionSet| event. 
Any of the previously discussed events can raise a set of internal triggers, |{i1,i2...}|, by introducing a guard that defines |{i1,i2...} <: SCXML_raisedTrigger| parameter (not shown in listings). 
As shown in listing~\ref{lst:SecBotMach0} an event that corresponds to a triggered transition uses the provided parameter |SCXML_it| (|SCXML_et| for externally triggered transitions) to define which trigger enables the event (see line~\ref{line:defTrigger}).
