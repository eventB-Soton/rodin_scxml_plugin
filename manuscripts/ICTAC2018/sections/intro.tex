\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Formal verification of high consequence systems 
requires the analysis of formal models that capture  
the properties and functionality of the system of 
interest. Proof obligations for systems' 
properties or requirements can be made more tractable 
using refinement, where properties are expressed in terms of variables that 
are introduced at different abstraction levels.  

A hierarchical development of a system model uses 
refinement concepts to link the different levels
of abstraction. Each subsequent level increases model 
complexity by adding details in the form of functionality and 
implementation method. As the model complexity increases 
in each refinement level, tractability of the detailed 
model can be improved by the use of a graphical representation, 
with rich semantics that can support an infrastructure 
for formal verification.

The Event-B language \cite{abrial10:_model_event_b} provides the logic and refinement
theory required to formally analyze a system model. 
The open-source Rodin tool \cite{abrial10:_rodin} provides support for Event-B including automatic theorem provers.
iUML-B \cite{snook14:_b_statem} augments the Event-B language with a graphical interface including state-machines.
