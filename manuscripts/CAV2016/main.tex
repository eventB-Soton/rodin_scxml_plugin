\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
High consequence systems benefit from verification by formal proof. 
However, to facilitate efficient automatic proof, notations are often restricted to 
simplify the verification of state changes. Engineers that are used to richer semantics 
may find these restrictions difficult to accept. 
Here we investigate the reconciliation of a Harel style statechart semantics with a 
declarative, substitution-based notation designed to facilitate proof. 
We provide a translation of State Chart eXtensible Markup 
Language (SCXML) statecharts into the Event-B formalism via the 
iUML-B state-machine notation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

% \textcolor{red}{This section should focus on the motivation behind pursuing a scxml 
% representation of our models, what are the benefits?}

Formal verification of high consequence systems 
requires the analysis of formal models that capture  
the properties and functionality of the system of 
interest. Proof obligations for systems' 
properties or requirements can be made more tractable 
using refinement, where properties are expressed in terms of variables that 
are introduced at different abstraction levels.  

A hierarchical development of a system model uses 
refinement concepts to link the different levels
of abstraction. Each subsequent level increases model 
complexity by adding details in the form of functionality and 
implementation method. As the model complexity increases 
in each refinement level, tractability of the detailed 
model can be improved by the use of a graphical representation, 
with rich semantics that can support an infrastructure 
for formal verification.

The Event-B language \cite{abrial10:_model_event_b} provides the logic and refinement
theory required to formally analyze a system model. 
The open-source Rodin tool \cite{abrial10:_rodin} provides support for Event-B including automatic theorem provers.
iUML-B \cite{snook14:_b_statem} augments the Event-B language with a graphical interface including state-machines.
 
 The goal of this work is to create a unified model 
representation capable of leveraging the structure and 
hierarchy that is inherently part of a statechart 
diagram, which will serve to enable the formal verification
of requirements in two stages. First, 
the translation of the unified representation to Event-B. Second,
the analysis of requirements related to the structure of 
the statechart itself, which is a higher level representation 
of the model than the Event-B provides. 

We base this unified statechart model representation 
on the State Chart eXtensible Markup 
Language (SCXML)  \cite{scxmlwebsite}.  
This is a general-purpose event-based state machine 
language that combines concepts from Call Control 
eXtensible Markup Language
(CCXML) and Harel 
State Tables. Harel State Tables are included in UML. 
The concrete syntax for SCXML
is based on XML. Hence, SCXML is an XML notation for 
UML style state-machines extended with an action 
language that is intended for call control features 
in voice applications.

In \S~\ref{sect:diff} we describe the semantics differences between SCXML and iUML-B 
and discuss their reconciliation. \S~\ref{sect:extension} presents the extensions 
made to SCXML for required Event-B  features, and \S~\ref{sect:future-work} provides some details 
regarding the development of the translation tool, finally \S~\ref{sect:future-work} list some of our future work. 

% An example statechart model is shown in figure  \ref{fig:StatemachineSCXML}, and a section of the corresponding SCXML syntax is shown in figure \ref{fig:scxml}. We use this example to illustrate points throughout the paper.

% \section{Case Study}
% \label{sect:caseS}

% \textcolor{red}{Find a system that we can model and some how describe the benefits 
% (e.g. model simplification) of using a specific syntax over the other.}
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 		\item What model behaviour can you capture with each semantic?
% 		\item What properties of the model are easier to simulate?
% 		\item Where do we introduce unnecessary complexity?

\section{Future Work}
\label{sect:future-work}
We have imported SCXML models into Event-B to bring the 
strong verification methods of Event-B to SCXML models. 
However, the significant semantic differences between SCXML 
and Event-B meant that we were forced to restrict the kinds 
of SCXML models we can support.
In particular the run-to-completion semantics of SCXML are 
difficult to support in Event-B without an explosion of 
artefacts to model the necessary sequentiality. 
In future work we will investigate the impact of the 
restrictions we have imposed on SCXML and whether 
additional support can be provided to lift or ease
such restrictions.
We will implement a return translation from iUML-B to SCXML 
to support round trip model development.
