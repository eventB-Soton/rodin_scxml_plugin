initially i modelled sending bytes without any internal events... just data and guards
this raises some intersting questions: 
1) can a sequence of un-triggered transitions progress
2) can the invariant concerning byte counter be proved - i added an invariant to do so

The sandia version does it by internal events. I started converting the model but maybe 
it is better to leave the illustration my way.

need to complete the use of sendmessage internal event (non-det setting at this level).
